# Networks-in-citations

Not all sources are good or right -- your own ideas may often be more accurate or interesting than those of your sources. Proper citation will keep you from taking the rap for someone else's bad ideas
Thus, citations are most important while researching using different unknown  research papers

A citation identifies for the reader the original source for an idea, information, or image that is referred to in a work. In the body of a paper, the in-text citation acknowledges the source of information used. 

Thus, we would be using graphsfor creating network between different entities. Here we have made two directed graph where first is the authors graph where all nodes are authors and there are edges as connection specifying collaboration on a research paper or citation of the research paper. 
On second graph, we have used papers as nodes and used the correlation for citations and stored the data in the databse as shown in the further upcoming slides.


We are using graphs for authors who are collaborating on a paper and citate others. 
The graphs used would be directed graph for the author’s as well as paper’s corelation
The author are being referred as the nodes in the graph where we 
search the user name in the graph.
In graph for papers we are using citations as the key concept over there.
We have also used graphical user interface as implementations for visualizing the two different graphs
